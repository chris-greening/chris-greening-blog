One of my favorite **productivity hacks** is to leverage my time wasted on chores (_i.e. cleaning, commuting, etc._) to listen to podcasts and audiobooks

So when I recently discovered [The Official AWS Podcast](https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/?podcast-list.sort-by=item.additionalFields.EpisodeNum&podcast-list.sort-order=desc&awsf.episode-type=*all&awsf.tech-category-filter=*all&awsf.product-filter=*all&awsf.industry-filter=*all) hosted by [Simon Elisha](https://twitter.com/simon_elisha?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) I was **super excited** to be able to expand on my [AWS certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) studies on-the-go!

With that being said I'm **compiling** an **unofficial playlist** of episodes from The Official AWS Podcast that I wish I knew about while studying for the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam:

This (work in progress) playlist is based on [my own personal experience](https://www.credly.com/badges/fcba784f-8894-42ca-88b0-591489a6cdc0/public_url) passing the exam with episodes I find **relevant** to understanding material the exam will quiz you on

So go ahead and pop this on in the background while you're on the train or cooking dinner - I guarantee you'll find it useful in your studies!

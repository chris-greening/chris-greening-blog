# Completing missing combinations of data with pandas' MultiIndex

Pandas MultiIndex is a powerful tool for handling multi-level indexing in pandas DataFrames allowing us to flexibly manipulate, prepare, and analyze complex datasets

Let's investigate how we can leverage MultiIndex to complete missing combinations of categories in our datasets 

## What is MultiIndex?

Pandas MultiIndex is a way of organizing and managing data in a pandas DataFrame with multiple levels of indexing. Think of it like having multiple layers of categories or labels for your data, where each layer helps you identify and categorize your data in a more specific and organized way. This makes it easier to work with large and complex data sets, as you can access and manipulate specific subsets of data based on their MultiIndex categories.

To help accomplish this, one of the top tools in the data professional's toolbox is pandas: a powerful and flexible data manipulation library built for Python

But as the complexity of our data grows, as does the complexity of our code

To quote some of Python's core tenets (via The Zen of Python):  

```.
Explicit is better than implicit. 
Simple is better than complex.

# Supercharging multiple join operations in R with beautiful tidyverse code

Joining structured data on shared columns is an incredibly common task in data preparation

And while it's fine to hardcode our join statements for two or three tables, what happens when we have to join 10 tables? 1,000 tables?

This is where the reduce operation shines!

So let's explore how we can leverage R and the tidyverse to join an arbitrary number of datasets on shared columns with elegant, readable code

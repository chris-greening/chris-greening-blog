# Connecting to a relational database using SQLAlchemy and Python

---

Congratulations!

You've just created your first SQLite database

Or maybe you read my previous blog post on [deploying a free tier relational database with Amazon RDS](https://dev.to/chrisgreening/deploying-a-free-tier-relational-database-with-amazon-rds-3jd2) :wink:

I have no idea! But I do know that you have a fancy database and now you want to access it from the comfort of Python

So let's jump into some code and learn how we can leverage [SQLAlchemy's](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) capabilities as _The Database Toolkit for Python_!

## Deconstructing the database URL
<!-- The most basic function of the Engine is to provide access to a Connection, which can then invoke SQL statements. To emit a textual statement to the database looks like: -->

## (Optional) Connecting to a remote MySQL instance on Amazon RDS

## Conclusion
<!-- ## What is SQLAlchemy?!

Yeahyeahyeah...

I literally just said _"Let's jump into some code"_ and now I'm yapping and not coding but _trust me_ - the journey is more important than the destination on this one

So... what is SQLAlchemy?!

As defined on the official website, SQLAlchemy is the "_Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application the full power and flexibility of SQL_"  -->

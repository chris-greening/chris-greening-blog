---

Congratulations!

You've just created your first SQLite database

Or perhaps you've been given remote access to a MySQL instance on Amazon RDS

I have no idea! But I do know that you have a fancy relational database and now you want to access it

Let's jump into some code and learn how we can leverage SQLAlchemy to connect to a relational database from the comfort of Python :snake:

## What is SQLAlchemy?!

Yeahyeahyeah...

I literally just said _"Let's jump into some code"_ and now I'm yapping and not coding but _trust me_ - the journey is more important than the destination on this one

So let's step back for a moment and understand the "_why_" before we launch into the "_how_"
